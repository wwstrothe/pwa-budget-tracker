## [Description](#table-of-contents)

This project takes provided starter code for a database enabled budget tracker and converts it into a functional Progressive Web Application (PWA) with offline access and functionality. The browser Cache API is used to store the application's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, controlled by a service worker. Offline transactions are stored using Indexed DB and are automatically uploaded when a connection is restored. A manifest file is also provided to allow the application to be downloaded to a browser, tablet, or phone.
